Likir
=====

Likir is a Kademlia Based Distributed Hash Table designed and initially developed by some university students. 
More info found here http://likir.di.unito.it/details.html
Academic Papers can be found at: http://likir.di.unito.it/papers.html

I am currently using Likir as a part of my M.Tech. Project to build a distributed Social network. During this usage, I have found some bugs in Likir, and have thus published it to fix those bugs, clean up the code and to make the code available to everyone.

Please contact me to join and contribute to this project. Any help will be highly appreciated
